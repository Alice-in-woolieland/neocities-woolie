                        <h3>About Her</h3>
                        I downloaded Tower of Fantasy largely because of the character creator. I love making original
                        characters, especially trying to create unique characters within somewhat limited character
                        creators. Tower of Fantasy strikes a good balance between allowing enough character
                        customization to
                        make unique characters, but not too much to make it hard to make an appealing character. <br>

                        As a thank you gift to my friend, I told them I'd draw them anything they requested. Of course,
                        they requested Kazuha smoking a joint. Yes, I gave him top surgery scars.<br>

                        <h3>About Her</h3>
                        Misha is one of my favorite Ocs, inspired visually from characters such as Maka from Soul Eater,
                        Zuko from ATLA, and Kagami from MLB. I originally designed her to have everything I like in a
                        character design, so I like to draw her in all sorts of outfits that I find visually
                        interesting.<br>

                        I designed Vio Lynn as a Vtubing Persona for myself to use. Her model is nowhere near complete,
                        however I'm planning on bringing her back from the dead (lol)<br>
                        I hope to bring her into reality eventually and stream as her!

                                    He is my oldest OC, made in 2017, and also one of my favorites. His appearance has shifted over the years. He generally stays the same age as me, so his current appearance doesn't nessesarily line up with the portrait above. He is my most "normal" OC, with his life story being pretty relaxed.

                        Robyn holds his cards close to his chest. He doesn't like to let others know what he is thinking. People find him kind of intimidating, and for good reason. He doesn't really want to talk to them. He isn't very social, only having a close few friends. With his friends, he is an entirely different person, loud, opinionated, and emotive. He spends his time playing video games, and he likes shooters. He also spends his time talking to his boyfriend, Jax.
                        <h3>History</h3>
                        In elementary school, he was a generally quiet kid, not talking to others. One kid talked to him after learning that Robyn liked video games, and they became good friends. Oliver was essentially Robyn's only friend all the way till highschool. Robyn never stopped Oliver from talking to others, since Oliver was relatively popular, maintaining many friendships, but Oliver always spent lunch with Robyn. Oliver was the first person to learn that Robyn was gay, back in middle school. In highschool, Robyn meets Jax, a new kid from Arizona. Robyn likes Jax almost instantly, a fact Oliver picks up on. Eventually, Robyn asks Jax out, and the rest is history.
