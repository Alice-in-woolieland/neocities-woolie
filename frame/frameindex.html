    <b>12/22/22:</b> Enabled offline editing through VScode thanks to my friend <a href="https://lipumeteorite.neocities.org/" target="_blank">meteroite!</a> go follow it. it's planning on making a tutorial on how to do this in the future + it's super cool so just go follow it <br>
    <b>11/29/22:</b> Added another shrine for my favorite character- reigen. So now i have reagan and reigen shrines LOL. both are pretty simple / not resource heavy. i could post them as simple templates on my webpage, but I'd have to clean them up and comment them- so I'll probably do it later!! anyways yay <br>
    <b>11/27/22:</b> Added a shrine for my latest kin who I gained against my will. Did some editing of the iframe as well so now it works properly! I'm quite proud of my hand coded pages. I made the shrine without a stylesheet and thank god for them. They make coding so much prettier- though a little less accessable. <br>
    <b>11/22/22:</b> Added about me + links to iFrame homepage, also added button on homepage to test out the beta! The beta page could use more decor + colors.<br>
    <b>11/21/22:</b> Added button + slight modifications. Working on a more "modern" iFrame style website, because I've always admired those, but I don't know if it'll look good. Guess I just gotta wait and see. <br>
    <b>11/18/22:</b> Website reskin, now it is green themed. Also reorganized a few files and deleted some old ones. General website cleanup. My current computer monitor doesn't render colors as vividly, so I didn't see how bright the red rendered on other monitors. Hopefully these colors are more pleasant. <br>
    <b>10/27/22:</b> Created website
