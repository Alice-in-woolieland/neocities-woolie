      <b>12/24/22:</b> Created a function that updates URL depending on what page you are on, allowing people to permalink to various sites. Huge thanks to Cody! :3
      <b>12/24/22:</b> Added page that loads a random image on refresh! I've been wanting to do this since I originally made this page, so it makes me really happy to see it finally completed. I'll add more images over time, however ideally I'll make a larger library once I upgrade to supporter status and get more storage. Until then, just appreciate the 13 or so images already in there. I hope to also add a webpage that shows what music I've been listening to, since I already have them all tracked through last.fm.<br>
      <b>12/23/22:</b> Finally swapped index completely over to the new webpage. Added pages about my characters, my pet
      bird, and links to my articles as well. Webpage can now redirect to specific iframe pages as well, allowing for
      direct links. (Large thanks to Coco's Dad!)<br>
      <b>12/22/22:</b> Enabled offline editing through VScode thanks to my friend <a
        href="https://meteoriterose.neocities.org/" target="_blank">meteroite!</a> go follow it. it's planning on making
      a tutorial on how to do this in the future + it's super cool so just go follow it <br>
      <b>11/29/22:</b> Added another shrine for my favorite character- reigen. So now i have reagan and reigen shrines
      LOL. both are pretty simple / not resource heavy. i could post them as simple templates on my webpage, but I'd
      have to clean them up and comment them- so I'll probably do it later!! anyways yay <br>
      <b>11/27/22:</b> Added a shrine for my latest kin who I gained against my will. Did some editing of the iframe as
      well so now it works properly! I'm quite proud of my hand coded pages. I made the shrine without a stylesheet and
      thank god for them. They make coding so much prettier- though a little less accessable. <br>
      <b>11/22/22:</b> Added about me + links to iFrame homepage, also added button on homepage to test out the beta!
      The beta page could use more decor + colors.<br>
      <b>11/21/22:</b> Added button + slight modifications. Working on a more "modern" iFrame style website, because
      I've always admired those, but I don't know if it'll look good. Guess I just gotta wait and see. <br>
      <b>11/18/22:</b> Website reskin, now it is green themed. Also reorganized a few files and deleted some old ones.
      General website cleanup. My current computer monitor doesn't render colors as vividly, so I didn't see how bright
      the red rendered on other monitors. Hopefully these colors are more pleasant. <br>
      <b>10/27/22:</b> Created website
