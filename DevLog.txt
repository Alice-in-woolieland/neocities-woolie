Hello! 

This is my secret log where I talk about what my plans are for my website.
Congrats for finding it. 

Though to be honest, you probably found it because I told you to look for it.

This way I can hopefully document how my website works for people who are interested.

As of 12/24/22, My index.html file is mostly an iframe that loads in simple webpages. 

You can think of it like a picture frame. It doesn't actually do much, other than having the buttons on the side for navigation.

The real meat of the webpage inside that frame- the "picture" so to speak.

Just because the frame doesn't do much though, doesn't mean it's simple. 

iframe is a very useful tool in html. It essencially creates a box in your webpage where you can render whatever you want. You can render images, videos, text, but for our purposes, I'm using it to render other webpages.

The buttons on the side of the Iframe, (The NaviBar), are actually regular old links. When you click them, I have it set up to open in the iframe, instead of the browser. 

I did this by giving the iframe a name- it's name is "mainHub" since it's the main section of the website. 

When you add an anchor tag into html, (<a>) you can actually choose a target for it to open up in. What I did was simple, I told it to open up in mainHub.

You can set it up for yourself on your own website by using the following snippet of code. 

<iframe name="mainHub">
<a href="/oldman.png" target="mainHub">old man</a>

Now, you might notice here, that if you use that, the iframe starts out blank. My website doesn't do that, and it's for a very simple reason. Similar to an <img> tag, you must give it a source to start. 

in reality, my website's code looks a little more like this-

<iframe name="mainHub" src="/frame/frameindex.html>

I have an index for my frame, a default home page that it can return to. 

Now, this works wonders for me, it looks clean, makes my website easy to navigate, saves on hosting costs-

however, there is one huge issue. I can't send people permalinks to specific pages on my website. I could send them links to the plain text files, but that looks unfinished and sloppy. 

It took me a while, and outsourcing for help, but I found a way to make it work. 

First things first, you need a script. I put this in my <head> on my index.html.

<script>
      function triggerBtnClick() {
         var urlHash = location.hash;
         if (urlHash !== null) {
            const buttonID = urlHash.slice(1);
            document.getElementById(buttonID).click();
         }
      }
</script>

What this script does is it checks to see if your url has a hash in it. If there isn't one, it does nothing. If you do have one however, It clicks the link with the same ID as the hash. 

So if I send a link that says : 'woolie.neocities.org/#skittles', 
It'll find "#skittles", remove the hash, making it "skittles" and then press the link with that ID.

As long as I give all of my links IDs, then I can redirect people to specific pages on my website. 

I have this function trigger on load, so it loads near instantly alongside the webpage. 

When you click on links, now it also adds a hash to my website url without refreshing. Using this code, also convieniently located in the <head> of my index.html file, 

<script>
      function urlUpdate(element) {
         window.history.pushState(element.id, '', '#' + element.id);
      }
</script>

Then, in the links you want to be able to redirect to, you add this section of code. 

onClick="urlUpdate(this)"

To recreate within your own website, copy this example code. 

<script>
      function urlUpdate(element) {
         window.history.pushState(element.id, '', '#' + element.id);
      }
</script>

<a href="#" id="websitelink" onClick="urlUpdate(this)">Link</a>

This script allows the funcion to take the element's ID and put it inside the URL without refreshing the page, so when the link is clicked, it adds a hash to the url. This behavior is perfect because it makes permalinking accessable, without overly bloating the code. 

For now, that's all I have to say about my webpage. I feel like the rest of it is pretty straightforward. I hope to add a directory page so that people can better inspect my code.
