  <h3>Ace Attorney</h3> <br>
  apollo justice kinnie. certified miles edgeworth apologist. phoenix wrights biggest fan.<br>
  I love ace attorney so much. <br>
  Here are my reviews of each case. Keep in mind that I do not write these from the perspective of someone who knows anything about good writing, nor do I play many visual novels. <br>
  For further information on my background with these series, I played all of these games within a month, and I love them all dearly. Every game to me is worth playing, but for different reasons.
