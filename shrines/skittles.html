    <h3> Skittles!!! </h3>
    <div class="borderbox">
    <div class="h4">4 years old, Australian Budgie, Disabled</div><br>
    Skittles is my pet budgie. He's a rescue, and has a broken wing. I clip his broken wing, because otherwise it overlaps with his normal one, causing him discomfort. He likes to eat tangerines and is scared of balloons, plush toys, and the dark. Skittles is a hen, however we use He/Him pronouns for him. <br><br>
